# Introducing soymonrs!

Are you tired of pressing monitor buttons over and over to cycle through input sources? Are you tired of searching through github for a solution that doesn't requires a usb or some cli input? Do you like rust? Well it turns out, I got something good here for yah. 

soymonrs is a rust ðŸ¦€ based app built on egui and ddc libraries to give you a simple Windows solution that lets you flip through input sources via dropdown. It ain't much, but it's honest work. ðŸ¤
